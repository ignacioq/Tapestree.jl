# INSANE

## Insane Bayesian data augmentation

INSANE uses Bayesian data augmentation (DA) to perform inference on a number of evolutionary models on phylogenetic trees. As such, performing inference will output posterior samples for the governing parameters as well as _complete_ or _data augmented_ trees, that is, trees that include probable configurations of unobserved variables such as the lineages that went extinct in the past or the underlying (latent) speciation rates.
